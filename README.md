# InteractWithVariable
This PowerShell function adds a basic console menu system for interacting with a variable that has one or many (array) simple values.

Future plans are:
  1. Allow custom validation of user input by a script block passed in as a parameter
  2. Allow custom validation of user input by a regular expression passed in as a parameter
